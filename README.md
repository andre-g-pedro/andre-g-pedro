## 🌟 About Me  

I’m a young professional who decided to change careers and pursue what truly inspires me: analyzing data and turning it into actionable insights. During my bachelor’s degree, I had already developed a strong interest in this field, and although I spent several years exploring a different path, I ultimately chose to return to it. Curiosity, dedication, and attention to detail have always guided me, and I’ve found in the world of data a place where these qualities can shine.

I believe data tells stories, and my goal is to keep learning how to listen, interpret, and communicate those stories through dashboards, reports, and predictive models.  

📌 What defines me:  
- 🔥 Highly motivated and eager to grow  
- 🎯 Committed to quality, accuracy, and consistency  
- 🤝 Strong team player with clear communication skills  
- 📈 Passionate about continuous personal and professional development
